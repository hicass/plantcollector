# Plant Collector

"Plant Collector" is a minimalist project designed to assist users in managing their house plants effectively. With a focus on simplicity and functionality, this Python-based application utilizes the Django framework to enable users to add and maintain a record of their plants. Users can conveniently track watering schedules, upload photos to monitor growth and health, and keep a record of the growing media used for each plant. The focus of developing this project is to enhance my Python skills, explore the fast application development capabilities of the Django framework, and get more experience working with a PostgreSQL database. Additionally, the project served as a platform to experiment and gain familiarity with the Materialize CSS framework. Which made focusing on functionality over the design of the app much easier.

### Next Steps:
- Add functionality to upload photos in a Growing Media's detail page.
- Create more functionality on Plant/ Growing Media detail pages so users could add more information (Ex: Plant/ Growing Media historical facts, notes the users would like to keep about their Plants/ Growing Medias, etc).  
- Add more styling for a more interactive/ engaging user experience.
